This is a solution to the Profile card component challenge!

## Overview

## My process

Initially, I sorted out HTML tags and divs I was gonna use for my CSS. Then I positioned elements using flexbox and started styling them. 
Task required my best judgement to place background images properly, so experimented with them until I found my golden solution.
In the end, I added media query for mobile screen and changed some styles to better view them on mobile screen. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Keyframes
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries


### What I learned

I learned working with background image, animation, transform, relative and absolute position, keyframes, box-shadow etc.


### Continued development

In the process of coming to the solution I had to make changes several times, It turned out to be kind of hard. 
To make this process easier I intend to learn Git.
